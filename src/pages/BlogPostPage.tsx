      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Web development is evolving at an unprecedented pace. As we move through 2025, several key trends are reshaping how we build and deploy web applications. This article explores the most significant developments and what they mean for developers and businesses.</p>

      <h2>AI-Powered Development</h2>
      <p>Artificial intelligence is no longer just a buzzword in web development. AI-powered tools are now assisting developers in writing code, debugging, and even designing user interfaces. GitHub Copilot and similar tools have become indispensable for many developers, significantly boosting productivity.</p>

      <h2>Edge Computing Takes Center Stage</h2>
      <p>Edge computing is revolutionizing how we think about web performance. By processing data closer to the user, edge functions enable lightning-fast response times and better user experiences. Platforms like Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, and Netlify Edge Functions are making edge computing accessible to developers of all skill levels.</p>

      <h2>React Server Components</h2>
      <p>React Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. By allowing components to render on the server, we can reduce bundle sizes, improve initial page loads, and create more efficient applications. This technology is set to become mainstream in 2025.</p>

      <h2>The Rise of Web Assembly</h2>
      <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is enabling high-performance applications in the browser that were previously impossible. From video editing to 3D games, Wasm is pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The future of web development is exciting and full of possibilities. By staying informed about these trends and continuously learning, developers can create increasingly sophisticated and performant web applications that delight users.</p>
