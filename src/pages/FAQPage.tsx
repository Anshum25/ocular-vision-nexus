    {
      question: "What is your typical project timeline?",
      answer: "Project timelines vary based on complexity. A basic website typically takes 4-6 weeks, while a custom mobile app or complex web application may take 3-6 months. We provide detailed timeline estimates during our initial consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer post-launch support and maintenance?",
      answer: "Yes! All our packages include post-launch support. Basic plans include 1 month, Standard includes 3 months, and Premium includes 12 months of support. We also offer ongoing maintenance contracts for long-term partnerships."
    },
    {
      question: "What is your payment structure?",
      answer: "We typically work with a 40-30-30 payment structure: 40% upfront to begin work, 30% at project midpoint, and 30% upon completion. For larger projects, we can discuss custom payment schedules."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work with our existing design or brand guidelines?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We can work with your existing brand guidelines, design systems, or Figma files. We're flexible and can adapt to your workflow and requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide source code and documentation?",
      answer: "Yes, upon project completion, you receive full ownership of all source code, design files, and comprehensive documentation. We believe in transparent delivery and knowledge transfer."
    },
    {
      question: "How do revisions work?",
      answer: "Each plan includes a specific number of revision rounds. We encourage consolidated feedback to make revisions efficient. Additional revisions beyond the package limit can be purchased at an hourly rate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you integrate with existing systems or APIs?",
      answer: "Yes, we specialize in integrations. Whether it's payment gateways, CRMs, marketing tools, or custom APIs, we have extensive experience connecting systems seamlessly."
    },
    {
      question: "What technologies do you work with?",
      answer: "We work with modern tech stacks including React, Next.js, Node.js, Flutter, React Native, Python, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). We choose the best tools for your specific needs."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you sign NDAs?",
      answer: "Yes, we're happy to sign NDAs and confidentiality agreements before discussing your project details. We take client privacy and intellectual property very seriously."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure project quality?",
      answer: "We follow industry best practices including code reviews, automated testing, security audits, and performance optimization. Every project goes through our rigorous QA process before delivery."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we start with a small project first?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Many of our long-term clients started with a small MVP or prototype. This is a great way to test our collaboration before committing to larger projects."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need changes after the project is complete?",
      answer: "Post-launch changes are normal! During the support period, minor changes are included. After that, we offer hourly rates or retainer packages for ongoing development and updates."
